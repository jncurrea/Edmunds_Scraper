This project uses web-scraping techniques with the goal of providing advice/insights based on Edmunds.com forum discussions. It's aim is to perform market research for any entry-level luxury brand that wants to break into the automotive field.
<br>
This project was separated into several tasks that allow easy reading for people who want to reference the project and easy troubleshooting. The steps were:

- Build the scraper for Edmund's Forum (Tools used: BeautifulSoup)
- Tokenizing comments and making sure Zipf's law holds
- Finding the top 10 popular brands by number of mentions
- Calculating lift values among brands to check association between brands (Is Brand B being mentioned when Brand A is mentioned?) 
- Calculating lift values between brands and common attribute (Is Brand A associated with luxury/performance/speed?)
- Calculating lift values between brands and "aspirational" messages (Is Brand A the brand that people aspire/want/wish for the most?)
- Conslusions and recommendations
<br>

### Step 1: Build Scraper
For this step, we built a scraper using BeautifulSoup. This scraper iterated over the first 300 pages of [Edmund's Discussion Forum](https://forums.edmunds.com/discussion/2864/general/x/entry-level-luxury-performance-sedans). <br> The flow we followed was:
- Iterate over each comment
- Append each message and respective date into a dictionary
- Go to next page <br>
For reference on the code, please refer to the [Source Code](https://github.com/jncurrea/Edmunds_Scraper/blob/main/Assignment1/edmunds_scraper.ipynb)

### Step 2: Tokenize and test Zipf's Law
For this step, we used the ".split()" method built in in python to tokenize the messages into list of words. One example of this method in action can be seen here: <br>
![Tokenization Example](https://github.com/jncurrea/Edmunds_Scraper/blob/main/Assignment1/Reference_Images/tokenization.png)
<br>
After tokenizing, we moved on to test Zipf's Law on our data. Recall Zipf's Law states that the frequency of an item is inversely proportional to its rank, or that the frequency decreases as the rank increases. Basically, the most common word will appear about twice as often as the second most common word, three times as often as the third most common word, and so on.
<br>
The following plots show the behaviours of all our words and the top 100 words (ranked by frequency):

<br>

#### Statistical Description

According to our statistical exploration, the slopes found in the previous problem are statistically different than the zipf's law slope of -1. Since the t scores are large and the p values are small, this means that we reject the null hypothesis. The standard deviations that result from the regression are extremely small, which is what causes a high t score and therefore a statistically significant difference between the slope produced and the -1 slope of the null hypothesis. 

### Step 3: Finding the top 10 popular brands by number of mentions
For this step, we scraped the [KBB Website](https://www.kbb.com/car-make-model-list/used/view-all/make/) to account for as most carbrands as we could. After scraping we performed a replacement process were we replaced specific models of a brand, for the actual brand name (e.g replacing m3 for BMW).<br> Refer to the [Make Model CSV](https://github.com/jncurrea/Edmunds_Scraper/blob/main/Assignment1/merged-1.csv) for more examples. <br> After performing this scraping process, we proceeded to find the top 10 brands by frequency of mentions in the comments. These brands are the following: <br>

### Step 4: Calculating lift values among brands to check for association
Now we start building data driven insights for any entry-level luxury brand that wants to break into the automotive field. Let's recall that lift values is a measurement used to check association between words. When we talk about association we are making reference to how often a word is mentioned when another word is mentioned (e.g how often is BMW mentioned when Audi is present in the same comment?) <br>
![Lift Formula](https://github.com/jncurrea/Edmunds_Scraper/blob/main/Assignment1/Reference_Images/lift_formula.png)
<br>
After performing this analysis and plotting the lift values, we can give some insights regarding brand perception and brand clustering

#### Brand Perception
- Lexus, Infiniti, and Acura are positioned close to each other in the MDS plot, indicating that consumers often mention these brands together. This suggests that they are perceived similarly in terms of features, quality, or value proposition in the entry-level luxury segment. JD Power should consider these brands as direct competitors and further investigate the specific attributes that consumers associate with them.
- Audi and BMW are relatively close in the plot but distinctly separate from other brands, indicating a strong presence in the luxury segment with unique positioning. These brands are likely competing for the same high-performance and luxury-focused consumer base. Any marketing or product strategy for these brands should focus on their performance and luxury heritage.

#### Brand Clustering
- Toyota, Nissan, and Honda are clustered away from the core luxury segment, indicating that while they may offer entry-level luxury models, they are primarily perceived as value-oriented or non-luxury brands. This could be due to their broader product range that includes more economy and family-oriented vehicles. JD Power could explore the potential for these brands to further penetrate the entry-level luxury market by enhancing luxury features or branding these specific models more distinctly.
- Chrysler is positioned separately from the other brands, which may reflect its divergence from the entry level luxury market. This distinct positioning can be an advantage, but JD Power should monitor whether Chryslerâ€™s brand perception aligns with entry-level luxury or if it is viewed more as a niche brand.

### Step 5: Calculating lift values between brands and common attributes
This step is very similar to Step 4, however, now we calculated lift values between brands and attributes related to brands (e.g performance, luxury, price, interior, power). <br>
After performing this analysis, we printed out a lift matrix that would tell us the lift values (association) between brands and attributes. The higher the value, the higer the association. One example of this is Audi and Price (lift value of 1.22). What that lift value is saying is that Audi is frequently mentioned when the word price is mentioned.
<br>

<br>

#### Insights offered
##### Strengths
- Audi and Cadillac: Both brands show strong lift values across multiple attributes, particularly in interior (Audi: 1.345, Cadillac: 1.573) and price (Audi: 1.222, Cadillac: 1.233). This suggests that they are perceived as leaders in providing high-quality interiors and justifying their pricing in the luxury segment. This perception aligns well with their positioning as premium brands.
- Honda and Toyota: Both brands have high lift values for luxury (Honda: 1.264, Toyota: 1.669) and performance (Honda: 1.157, Toyota: 1.218). Despite not traditionally being considered luxury brands, their entry-level luxury models seem to be well-regarded in these aspects. This could indicate growing acceptance of these brands in the luxury market.
##### Weaknesses
- Infiniti and Lexus: Both brands show lower lift values in luxury (Infiniti: 0.734, Lexus: 0.879) and performance (Infiniti: 0.812, Lexus: 0.932). For brands positioned as luxury, this could indicate that their current models are not perceived as competitive in these key attributes. They may need to invest in enhancing these aspects to improve their market position.
- BMW: The lift value for luxury (0.899) is relatively lower compared to competitors like Cadillac (1.186) and Audi (1.050). BMW might need to focus on reinforcing its luxury credentials to maintain its competitive edge.

##### Disclaimer
Without sentiment analysis, it is difficult to say whether or not these co-occurances occurred with positive or negative connotation. In that regard, we can't say whether or not, for example, toyota is the most luxurious car. We can say, however, that when car enthusiasts are on the topic of luxury, they are often also talking about toyotas. What's more telling is that in these luxury discussions, infiniti and lexus are not being mentioned, which are meant to be positioned as more luxurious than toyota or honda. A deeper sentiment is suggested in order to uncover if these conversations are indicating that toyota and honda are, say, comparable to luxury cars. These findings hightlight a lot of potential areas to delve deeper into this discussion data, since there are many findings that are unexpected compared to what we know about the ideal marketing of these brands.

### Step 6: Calculating lift values between brands and "aspirational" messages

Again, a very similar process as in steo 5 was performed here. We got human-generated sentences representing aspiration such as forever car, wish I had, etc... Then, we performed a replacement process where we replaced these sentences with the word "aspire".<br>
After the replacement, we performed the same lift calculations, however, now we did it between brands and the word "aspiration". 

![Lift values for brands and aspiration](https://github.com/jncurrea/Edmunds_Scraper/blob/main/Assignment1/Reference_Images/asp_lift.png)

### Step 7: Conclusions and Recommendations
It seems as though BMW, Audi, and Nissan are most highly associated with with the term "aspire". Meanwhile, the brands Toyota, Lexus and Infiniti are the least associated with "aspire". Thus, I would recommend to a firm that they should push to mimic the feel of the BMW, Audi, and Nissan if they are trying to amp up their demand. 

Moreover, it's important to note that BMW and Audi are the only brands with a positive lift, meaning that people aspire to have these two car brands, and much less so with the others.
