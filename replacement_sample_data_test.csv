03/25/2002,i am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my list. the price difference between these two is approx. 6k (non-type s acura). is the lexus worth 6k over the acura? i don't know because i have never owned a acura but i am familiar with the lexus(previous generation). supposedly the 2002 lexus is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the acura? of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability. does the acura compare with the lexus in both of these categorys? i am not familiar with the honda co. are prices lower than lexus for service work? i would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some acura owners.

so imo, it's not even on the board, let alone the 'easy winner'."
